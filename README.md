## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Kaggle 'Airbnb Seattle' dataset to find out:
1. When is the best time to rent out a flat
2. Where is the best location and whats the kind of flat (location, size, etc.) to buy for a side business
3. How well is the price of a flat predictable?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is 1 notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions. The notebook contains all code to anwer the above mentioned questions. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@samperdaniel/when-and-where-to-book-an-airbnb-in-seattle-a-guide-to-save-money-8e88f5d6d724)).
